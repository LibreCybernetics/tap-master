# Why Scala is so much fun

I would argue that the challenge of writing programs, is to correctly express the problem at hand as simple and correct
as possible.

Scala when used properly allow you to:

1. Easily model the domain.
2. Control complexity.
3. Be declarative.
4. Bonus: be performant.

That translates into today's Scala tour:

1. ADTs, type classes, functions as assertions.
2. Immutability, referential transparency, effect modeling.
3. For comprehensions, pattern matching.

### Usage

This is a normal sbt project. You can compile code with `sbt compile`, run it with `sbt run`, and `sbt console` will start a Scala 3 REPL.

For more information on the sbt-dotty plugin, see the
[scala3-example-project](https://github.com/scala/scala3-example-project/blob/main/README.md).
